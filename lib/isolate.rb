  # Valid options:

  # :cleanup:: Should obsolete gems be removed? Default is +true+.

  # :install:: Should missing gems be installed? Default is +true+.

  # :multiruby:: Should Isolate assume that multiple Ruby versions

  # :system:: Should system gems be allowed to satisfy dependencies?
  #           Default is +true+.
  #
  # :verbose:: Should Isolate be chatty during installs and nukes?
